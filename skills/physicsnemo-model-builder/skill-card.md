## Description: <br>
Official NVIDIA-authored workflow for adding a new model or reusable layer to PhysicsNeMo, or integrating an existing PyTorch model. Scaffolds a standards-compliant `physicsnemo.Module` (or a `Module.from_torch` wrapper), places it correctly, wires exports, writes tests, and runs the local CI gates. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Contributors and researchers adding a new model or reusable layer to the PhysicsNeMo package, or porting an existing PyTorch `nn.Module` into PhysicsNeMo so it follows the repository's model-implementation standards (placement, serialization, docstrings, typing, validation, tests) and passes CI. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The skill scaffolds and edits source files; generated code could be incorrect, incomplete, or place files in the wrong location if the live repository structure differs from assumptions. <br>
Mitigation: The skill verifies paths against the live repo before citing them, runs the CI gates (ruff, interrogate, pytest) and an independent code-review pass over the diff before completion, and defers the model's novel architecture to the human. Review the diff and the CI result before merging. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Code scaffolding, File edits, Analysis] <br>
**Output Format:** [Python, Markdown] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [N/A] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [Generated files are standards-compliant skeletons completed by the contributor; the skill does not author the model's novel architecture.] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`claude-code`) <br>
- Codex (`codex`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 4 internal evaluation tasks (2 positive skill-activation, 2 negative) with 2 attempts per task via NVSkills-Eval. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>
